# School Calendar App

## Description
The School Calendar App allows users to see all upcoming activities in the school. It retrieves this data from an external server (provided by the teacher), and displays it to the user in a list format. The app allows the user to indicate their participation in each activity, share the activity information with others (via SMS), and even modify the activity including its name and meeting times (provided that they are authorized to do so). 

This app was developed for the Android platform, and the code was written in Java.

## Installation
### Option 1: Android Emulator
The app can be tested using the [Android Emulator](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator). Note that while any virtual device can be used, the app was developed and tested using a Nexus 5 virtual device running Android 5.1.
