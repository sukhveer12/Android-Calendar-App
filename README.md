# Android Calendar App
## Description
The School Calendar App allows users to see all upcoming activities in the school. It retrieves this data from an external server (provided by the teacher), and displays it to the user in a list format. The app allows the user to indicate their participation in each activity, share the activity information with others (via SMS), and even modify the activity including its name and meeting times (provided that they are authorized to do so).
